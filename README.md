# Goal
My goal is to build a functional notes app. A app where you can take notes, edit it, or delete it. I plan to build it with HTML CSS and JavaScript to grasp the best practices. 
I am also learning from a seasoned web developer on YouTube who is going through the process of building a notes app as well. I plan to learn more and gain better
skills on building apps.

# Challenges
The challnge that I went through when building this involved some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, this is a good thing because I am growing and learning
how to strengthen necessary skills. 

#Solution
I have learned the best practices. I have found solutions to the challenges I have faced. It is as simple as using divs, certain CSS code, and as well as JavaScript code. 
As you come along the code I have been using to build the app, you will be able to see the different changes I have made, and solutions added to make this app function better.
